# **Pages**

The files in this directory are the `pages` that are used in the [`page object model`](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) approach.

Here you will find an example [`test_divs_page.rb`](pages/test_divs_page.rb) which has been created to demonstrate the structure of the pages themselves, whilst also assisting with the example features. 
There is a list of page elements used in the example features from Google and then after that there are some examples of how to input further elements using different identifiers.

Multiple pages can be stored in one file however you can also create new files for each page if you want to maintain nice clean files that are not massive.
