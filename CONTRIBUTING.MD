## **What Can You Contribute?**

There are lots of ways to contribute to oTTo

- Bug reporting and fixing
- Features
- Keep code up to date with general maintenance
- Boilerplate step definitions
- Cheatsheet writing and editing
- Translating README files into other languages
- Speaking to Maintainers about porting projects (_if you are interested in this, please contact founding maintainers_)

There are also many other ways that we have not thought of, so if you have an idea or want to contribute, keep reading!

## **Ground Rules and Expectations**

A few things that are expected from you, and you can expect from others:

- Be kind and considerate. Everyone is different and this is a **tool for learning and to help others**. Other people will not have the same experience or knowledge as you and this is a chance to help and teach those who wish to learn and ask questions.
- Everything here is done under our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you agree to abide by its terms
- Any PR will need to pass all [tests](unit_tests). This is a tool by QAs for QAs, it should pass testing :wink:. PR's will be rejected if they are not passing
- All new features and functions **must have** unit tests where applicable.

## **How To Contribute**

If you would like to contribute, start by searching through [issues](https://github.com/Alpenglow88/oTTo/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/Alpenglow88/oTTo/pulls) to see if someone has already raised your idea or question. It could be a perfect chance to get involved and help out.

If it isn't there, great!

- **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull request.
- **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the discussion before you do any work.

At the moment, there is only one maintainer so please bear with me if it takes a little time to get to!

## **Becoming a Maintainer**
